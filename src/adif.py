# This is an ADIF parser in Python.

# It knows nothing about ADIF data types or enumerations,
# everything is a string, so it is fairly simple.

# But it does correcly handle things like:
# <notes:66>In this QSO, we discussed ADIF and in particular the <eor> marker.
# So, in that sense, this parser is somewhat sophisticated.

# Main result of parsing: List of QSOs.
# Each QSO is one Python dict.
# Keys in that dict are ADIF field names in upper case,
# value for a key is whatever was found in the ADIF, as a string.
# Order of QSOs in the list is same as in ADIF file.
